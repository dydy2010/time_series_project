# Motivation and Objective

## Project Objectives

For example: Investigate the dynamic relationship between SNB’s policy
interest rates and Swiss core inflation. Determine directional causality
between these two variables. Analyze the impact and timing of policy
rate adjustments on inflation.

## Motivation

Personal/team motivation: We share an academic interest in exploring the
world of financial analysis, and it is also great that we can add
practical relevance in a Swiss context. Additionally, it is applicable
to career interests (finance/trading). Real-world relevance: In today’s
volatile economic landscape, it is beneficial for individuals and
institutions to understand inflation dynamics. Such insights can
contribute to better financial or policy decisions. It is relevant for
policymakers, investors, and researchers.

## Research Questions

For example: Does SNB policy rate significantly influence core
inflation? Is there evidence of bidirectional causality between policy
rates and core inflation? How quickly and how strongly do core inflation
rates respond to policy changes?

# Theory, literature and methodology,

To answer our research questions, we first needed to clarify what the
basis for modern monetary policy is. Why do central banks raise and
lower interest rates according to inflation? For that, a benchmark for
monetary policy theory is Taylor’s rule, in which he defined the formula
for the targeted rate of central banks. “Put simply, the Taylor rule
says that the Federal Reserve should raise the interest rate when
inflation increases and lower the interest rate when gross domestic
product (GDP) declines. The desired interest rate is one-and-a-half
times the inflation rate, plus one-half times the gap between GDP and
its potential, plus one.” \[Mark23\]

Then the next clarification is: how does Switzerland evaluate and
implement monetary policy to foster economic prosperity? After trying
out some datasets, we discovered the following statements: “Since the
beginning of 2000, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has used a range for
the three-month Swiss franc Libor as its announced target for monetary
policy.” “Before 2000, the Swiss National Bank officially targeted
monetary aggregates, using a medium-term target for the
seasonally-adjusted monetary base.”\[Schi00\]

Then for the analysis, we have adopted the theory and practice what we
have learned in TSA classes. For example, VAR modeling, stationarity
testing, Granger causality, lag-lead effect, and ARIMA.

# Data selection

First, after some research, we started the analysis with a dataset from
SNB, “Interest rates and threshold factor” \[Inte00a\], afterwards is
called Dataset 1. It includes policy rate, interest rate on sight
deposits above threshold, special rate, SARON fix etc. For inflation
data, we have used core inflation, trimmed mean from “Consumer prices –
SNB and SFSO core inflation rates” \[Cons00b\]. In Dataset 1, the
threshold is optimal to be used as the interest rate policy target, and
because before 2009 there is no threshold data in Dataset 1, we have
used the special rate. From 13 June 2019, the special rate was based on
the current SNB policy rate plus a surcharge of 50 basis points. The
special rate always amounted to at least 0.5 percent”\[Inte00\].
Additionally, we determined that the SARON fix rate is the market
reaction to the policy target, so it shouldn’t be used as the policy
rate to be analyzed.

The trial analysis has been successful; we could give certain findings
and conclusions applying ARIMA, VAR, and linear regression. However, we
were not satisfied with the different rate types; it seemed puzzling
that we had to convert and “compromise” to the seemingly complicated
data. So, we researched more, and we did find a second dataset
(afterwards called Dataset 2). It only contains 2 types of data to be
considered official interest rate, which is more consistent and more
appropriate to take as the policy rate. “From 13 June 2019, the SNB
policy rate is applied. From 3 January 2000 until 13 June 2019, the SNB
set a target range for the three-month Swiss franc Libor” \[Snbd00\].
With the second dataset, we’ve also done a VAR to evaluate if there is
causality between policy rate/target to inflation, or inflation to the
policy decisions, which with both datasets, no causality was proven.
This also gives us more confidence that both datasets represent the
reality well, even though the dataset 2 seemed more consistent.

# Team collaboration and tool set

## Team organization and meetings

Team structure: For our team of 2, we both shared responsibility for all
aspects of the project; however, with a focus on different aspects. For
example, Daniel presented the initial idea, Dongyuan focused more on
methodology and research, Daniel focused more on coding diverse models,
and Dongyuan delved into finding more data options during the project.
We reached team consensus through weekly meetings and follow-ups. The
tasks were also interest-based according to both team members. Meeting
schedule: weekly meetings were set up on Monday/Tuesday at 14:00, and
frequent follow-ups took place.

## Collaborative tools

### Brainstorming and ideation:

Miro Board - Initial concept visualization - Real-time collaboration on
ideas and analysis structure - Organizing literature and conceptual
mapping

### Task Distribution and Project Management

Excel - Task assignment tracking - Deadlines and progress monitoring -
Visualization of milestones and status

### Coding and Version Control

RStudio GitHub - coding environment - collaborative script development -
version control - merging and conflict resolution workflow -
documentation of code changes and version tracking

### Documentation and Presentation

Quarto - Unified document format (code, analysis, interpretation) -
Integration of R code and results - Final report preparation (paper and
presentation) - Consistent style and format across deliverables.

## Reflection on tool set effectiveness

-   Miro is a great tool for visualization and brainstorming. With
    downside that it can be information-intensive for new users.
-   RStudio code collaboration has its learning curve. It was
    challenging for the first 2 weeks for us to get used to save,
    commit, pull and push. But in the end, after getting used to it, we
    think it is a great tool for R collaboration in team. Although it
    does not allow to work at the same document at the same time.
-   Recommendations for future projects: collaboration tool set and team
    structure take time to form. For short projects, it takes time to
    getting used to them. However, we are happy that we tried out these
    tools: It gave us a chance to learn some essential and popular
    options in the data science world.
