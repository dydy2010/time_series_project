# Findings, discussion and limitations

## Key findings


1.  **Weak Linear Regression and Lag Effects**\
    A basic linear regression showed no significant relationship between
    policy rates and inflation (p \> 0.05; R² ≈ 0.004). Even when
    including lags of up to 12 months, only lag 1 and lag 10 were
    statistically significant. Overall explainability was low (adjusted
    R² ≈ 0.02). It suggests weak evidence of delayed effects.

2.  **Low evidence of event effect**\
    After treating major SNB policy changes as events, October 2022 had
    a statistically significant effect on inflation (p almost 0). This
    suggests a large policy major change (from negative to positive
    rates in 2022) could have delayed effect on inflation. However,
    overall explainability was still low (R² ≈ 0.04).

3.  **Granger Causality (VAR Model) but not dterministic** \
    The Granger causality test showed that policy rates Granger-cause
    inflation (p ≈ 0.024). It suggested that past policy rate changes
    help predict inflation, but remember, no causality can be
    determined. On the other hand, inflation did not Granger-cause
    policy rates (p ≈0.29). This suggests that the SNB reacts
    independently of recent inflation trends, which is conter-intuitive,
    but the data suggests such story might be the reality .

4.  **ARIMA Forecastin suggests reverting behavior** \
    Forecasts suggest a auto-reverting inflation trend that once it
    rises, autoregression tend to happen. We have also done forecast, no
    significant changes of inflation was predicted.

## Limitations

-   **Limited Prediction Power**: Most models (especially linear
    regression) show very low R² values, indicating weak predictive
    power.

-   **Two Variables**: The models only consider two variables: policy
    rate and core inflation. Other factors like global energy prices,
    pandemic and trade wars were not included.

Despite these limitations, the analysis contributes to understanding how
SNB policy rates and inflation interact. It offers a foundation for more
complex modeling in future studies.

# Discussion

Why combining ARIMA and Granger causality test: **ARIMA**: Univariate
model: It uses only past values of inflation to forecast future
inflation. It does not include other variables (e.g., policy events).

**Granger Causality Test**: Multivariate test: It checks if a variable
(like our events or interest rate change) helps predict inflation.

Are the results consistent?

**The results are actually consistent, without contradiction**:

Granger shows: policy interest rate dosen’t help predict inflation.
ARIMA shows inflation doesn’t change much, its own past doesn't predict
much either. And we have found reverting behavior of inflation rate
itself, and some major policy event's effect on inflation.

So, most models point to weak relationships, not showing clear
autocorrelation, with some insights of event and autoregression. The
results were consistent withouth contradiction.

## Conclusion

Our team analyzed the relationship between SNB policy rates and
inflation rate in Switzerland. We applied time series models for the
analysis.

Weak connections between the two variables were found, lacking strong
correlation or deterministic evidence.

However, some non-deterministic effects were also observed:

-   Granger causality indicates that past policy rate changes have some
    predictive value for inflation.

-   event-based regression suggest a mild connection between higher
    policy rate and lower inflation with delayed effect.

-   Arima suggests autoregression and reverting behavior on inflation
    rate.

The findings suggest that inflation in Switzerland could be influenced
by a broader set of factors, including monetary policy, but not limited
to it.

Future research could expand on this work by including more variables,
testing other models, analyzing specific events' effect on inflation
rate, and their relationship with policy decisions.
