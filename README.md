### Research question
Is the Swiss National Bank (SNB) really driving inflation rates or is it more the other way round? 

### Data sources

- inflation rates (since 1983).

### Methods
- data preparation
- data visualization
- check stationarity
- check cross-correlations
- causality tests (i. e. Granger tests, lagged regression)
- maybe: ARIMA for more detailed insights.

### Options
Add further data, e. g.:
- Swiss economy (gross domestic product GDP)
- Exchange rates (CHF-USD or CHF-EUR).
