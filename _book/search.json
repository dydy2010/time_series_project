Its main objective is to maintain price stability by controlling inflation in Switzerland. During the recent history, Switzerland has maintained a low and stable inflation rate, “from 1960 to 2024, the average inflation rate was 2.4% per year. Overall, the price increase was 346.12%. For 2024, an inflation rate of 1.3% was calculated”[Infl00].",

The first with Cook’s distance &gt;0.6 is highly influential, the other with Cook’s distance around 0.3 is moderately influential. High Cook’s distance values indicate impact on the model’s coefficient, but it requires further inspections (e.g. is it an outlier or a data error), then a decision on how this data point should be treated (transformed or removed) should be made.\nAfter checking the dates in the data, we did find major policy rate changes:\n\n2001_09_01 was a full 1% step down from 2.75% to 1.25%, starting a continuous decrease to 0%.\n2008_11-01 was the last 0.5% step of a continuous decrease of the policy rate from 2.25 to 0.\n2023-03-01 the policy rate was the last 0.5% step in a continuous interest rate hike from -0.75%.\n\nThese 3 events are reflection of substantial economic interventions by the SNB, so we tend towards accepting these residuals as facts.\n\n# plot(lin_reg, which = 1)  # Residuals vs Fitted\n# plot(lin_reg, which = 2)  # Q-Q plot\nplot(lin_reg, which = 4)  # Cook's distance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4.5 Durbin-Watson test\n\nTest for serial correlation\nNull hypothesis that residuals are not autocorrelated\nTest statistic is very close to 2, which is the expected value under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation (p &gt; 0.05).

It doesn’t necessarily mean that the model is wrong, the reasons could be that:\n\nInflation is affected by many more factors.\nTime series data in economic events and shocks can be noisy.\nLinear relationship is weak but statistically significant and economically justifiable.\n\n::: {.content-visible format-pdf} :::\n::: {.content-visible format-html}\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Alternatives to the basic linear model\n\n3.2.5.1 Alternative 1: Lead-lag relation: infl(t) = a + b * policy_rate(t-1) + e(t)\nCreate lagged variables and fit the linear model, removing rows with NA due to lagging.\n\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag1 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 1)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag2 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 2)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag3 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 3)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag4 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 4)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag5 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 5)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag6 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 6)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag7 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 7)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag8 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 8)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag9 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 9)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag10 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 10)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag11 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 11)\ndf_differenced$policy_rate_lag12 &lt;- stats::lag(df_differenced$policy_rate, k = 12)\n\nlin_reg_lagged &lt;- lm(infl ~ policy_rate_lag1 + policy_rate_lag2 + policy_rate_lag3 +\n                       policy_rate_lag4 + policy_rate_lag5 + policy_rate_lag6 +\n                       policy_rate_lag7 + policy_rate_lag8 + policy_rate_lag9 +\n                       policy_rate_lag10 + policy_rate_lag11 + policy_rate_lag12,\n                     data = na.omit(df_differenced))\nsummary(lin_reg_lagged)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = infl ~ policy_rate_lag1 + policy_rate_lag2 + policy_rate_lag3 + \n    policy_rate_lag4 + policy_rate_lag5 + policy_rate_lag6 + \n    policy_rate_lag7 + policy_rate_lag8 + policy_rate_lag9 + \n    policy_rate_lag10 + policy_rate_lag11 + policy_rate_lag12, \n    data = na.omit(df_differenced))\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.48931 -0.09963 -0.00025  0.08991  0.48523 \n\nCoefficients:\n                    Estimate Std.

This could imply some short- and delayed reaction of inflation to past policy decisions. But R squared (0.06249, adjusted 0.02187) is very low, only 6% of the variance (fluctuations) in inflation can be explained by the model.\nLag 1 could make sense regarding the time frame and the model shows that it is statistically significant. But the direction of lag 1 is not as expected: a higher policy rate goes with higher inflation.\nLag_10 could make sense as the estimate is negative. Though it is common that a change in the policy rate has a quite delayed effect on inflation rates, but we wonder why only Lag_10 shows this effect and nearby months don’t? The overall credibility of the lag effect is questionable.\nOur conclusion: As only 6% of variation is explained by the model and the two significant lags are against theory or questionable, we are not convinced by this model.\n\n\n3.2.5.2 Alternative 2: Treat SNB actions as events\n\ndf_differenced$event_2008_10 &lt;- ifelse(index(df_differenced) &gt;= as.Date(\"2008-10-01\"), 1, 0)\ndf_differenced$event_2014_11 &lt;- ifelse(index(df_differenced) &gt;= as.Date(\"2014-11-01\"), 1, 0)\ndf_differenced$event_2020_01 &lt;- ifelse(index(df_differenced) &gt;= as.Date(\"2020-07-01\"), 1, 0)\ndf_differenced$event_2022_05 &lt;- ifelse(index(df_differenced) &gt;= as.Date(\"2022-05-01\"), 1, 0)\ndf_differenced$event_2022_10 &lt;- ifelse(index(df_differenced) &gt;= as.Date(\"2022-10-01\"), 1, 0)\n\nlin_reg_events &lt;- lm(infl ~ event_2008_10 + event_2014_11 + event_2020_01 + event_2022_05 + event_2022_10, data = na.omit(df_differenced))\nsummary(lin_reg_events)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = infl ~ event_2008_10 + event_2014_11 + event_2020_01 + \n    event_2022_05 + event_2022_10, data = na.omit(df_differenced))\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.46667 -0.07671  0.00441  0.08942  0.58942 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

After checking the dates, 2022 October was exactly where SNB was continuously lowering rates for months, due to economic slow down in Europe, global energy crisis, and a 25% draw back of global stock markets.\nOverall interpretation of residual analysis:\nResiduals are not heteroskedastic or auto_correlated, but the non-normality remains an issue. It might be neglected as we have 302 observations (large n tends towards normality). The model is overall valid, though incorporating other factors or considering nonlinear models in futures studies could be beneficial.",

    "text": "Linear Regression model with Lag Effects shows weak relations\nA basic linear regression showed no significant relationship between policy rates and inflation (p &gt; 0.05; R² ≈ 0.004). When including lags of up to 12 months, lag 1 and lag 10 were statistically significant. While in this context a lag of 10 months might be feasible, we still have doubts. Overall explanatory power was low (adjusted R² ≈ 0.02). It suggests only weak evidence of delayed effects.\nLinear Regression model with SNB events shows evidence of one event in 2022\nAfter treating major SNB policy changes as events, October 2022 had a statistically significant effect on inflation (p close to 0). This suggests that a major policy change (from negative to positive rates in 2022) might have had an effect on inflation. However, overall explanatory power was still very low (R² ≈ 0.04).\nGranger Causality (VAR Model) but not deterministic\nThe Granger causality test showed that policy rates Granger-cause inflation (p ≈ 0.024). It suggested that past policy rate changes help predict inflation. But remember, no causality can be determined. On the other hand, inflation did not Granger-cause policy rates (p ≈0.29). Either the SNB really acts independently of recent inflation trends, which is against theory, or we just did not find an appropriate model to prove that SNB policy reacts to inflation rates.\nARIMA forecasting suggests reverting behavior\nAn ARIMA(5,1,0) model on inflation rates shows significant auto-regressive effects of lags 1-5 on inflation rates. The negative estimates in all lags suggest an auto-reverting effect: a rise in inflation is followed by an decrease. We have also done forecast, but no significant changes of inflation were predicted.",

Other factors like global energy prices, the pandemic or global trade conflicts were not included.\n\nDespite these limitations, the analysis contributes to understanding how SNB policy rates and inflation interact. It offers a foundation for more complex modeling in future studies.",

    "text": "4.3 Discussion\nAre the results from linear regression (SNB event), ARIMA (5,1,0) and Granger causality test consistent?\nLinear regression: There is an effect of a major SNB change in policy rate, but the model only explains a small portion of variance in inflation rates.\nARIMA: It uses past values of inflation to forecast future inflation so it is a univariate model, not taking into account other variables (e.g., policy events).\nGranger Causality Test: Multivariate test: It checks if variables (like our events or interest rate changes) help to explain each other better then they are explained by themselves.\nThe results are actually consistent, without contradiction:\nBased on the linear regression model a major change in SNB policy rates explains inflation rates variance, but only a very small portion of it. ARIMA shows an auto-regressive reverting effect, inflation can be in parts be explained by itself. But , without further checking the quality of the ARIMA model, the respective forecast based on this model was not convincing. Finally, the Granger causality test shows an effect of policy rates on inflation, suggesting that it can help explaining inflation. The other way round, there is no effect of inflation rates on policy rate.\nSo, our analysis suggests an effect of SNB policy rates on inflation, which is itself auto-correlated. But all relationships and model are rather to very weak. Meaning our results were consistent without contradiction but only show weak effects.",
